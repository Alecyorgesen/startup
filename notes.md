# Notes

I learned how to merge conflicts, and that's super important. There is a menu that helps you to do in in vscode. It's pretty simple, you can include both changes, or only one of them.

Also, [here](/README.md) is the readme file.

## HTML

Alright, so I've learned about HTML today, and it doesn't seem too bad. Important things to remember are:
- <a href="some url here">This is a link</a>: This is how you create a link.
- <img src="url_to_some_image" alt="description of picure in case you can't see it" width="number" height="number">Text as well?</img>: This is how you display an image.

## URL Website Name

- The url is rpsshowdown.click.
- <a href="https://rpsshowdown.click">Rock Paper Scissors Showdown</a>
