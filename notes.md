# Notes

I learned how to merge conflicts, and that's super important. There is a menu that helps you to do in in vscode. It's pretty simple, you can include both changes, or only one of them.

Also, [here](/README.md) is the readme file.

## HTML

Alright, so I've learned about HTML today, and it doesn't seem too bad. Important things to remember are:
- <a href="some url here">This is a link</a>: This is how you create a link.
- <img src="url_to_some_image" alt="description of picure in case you can't see it" width="number" height="number">Text as well?</img>: This is how you display an image.

## URL Website Name

- The url is rpsshowdown.click.
- <a href="https://rpsshowdown.click">Rock Paper Scissors Showdown</a>

## Simon

- I got Simon up and running on my server. I've looked at it a bit, and now I'm going to work on creating the pages for my startup.

## CSS

- To be perfectly clear, I think that css using dashes instead of underscores is silly.
- Anyway, I learned a lot about things like putting the element you want to effect first, opening up with braces, using background-color: (hex number) to change the color of things, and yeah.
- There are so many things to learn, and there is no way I'm going to memorize them all, but that's what A.I. is for these days huh.

## Bootstrap

- This kind of does the CSS for you in a way. It's really nice, and it means things become a lot simpler.
