# Rock Paper Scissors Showdown

### Elevator pitch

The web application is just going to be a bit of fun. It will be rock, paper, scissors but with the twist that you need to choose rock, paper, or scissors in five different boxes, and then your opponents five go against your five. You have a few rounds of this until you either reach a certain number of wins. If you tie, you continue until one has more than the other.
